Data Visualizations dedicated to analyzing wildlife data within Central Oregon for Think Wild

I have created a variety of plots dedicated to answering multiple questions posed by Think Wild. We have collaborated together to discuss the best charts to best explain some of the questions and help visualize and organize the data better to give more meaning to the variety of reports throughout Central Oregon.



1. Where are Mallards most commonly getting hit by cars?

Since we are answering the question of where, how and when in this question, the visualizations I dedicated for this question was to answer the season of time, how often throughout the year, and where are they getting hit. The Time Series Analysis was perfect for giving an analysis throughout both years, as well as the Calendar Heatmap giving a better frequency visualization throughout each month. The Choropleth map would be better used to understand where the reports are more commonly being seen. The data I focused on was Situational reports that were labeled under HBC, as well as animals with the code MALL. Despite the small sample size of incident reports, the data informed us that April-May time was usually the time that Mallards were getting hit, and it was primarily occuring in the Bend/Redmond Areas.

2. How long does baby season last based on species/class/order?

In this question, we are focusing on babies that have been spotted in the Central Oregon Area. By using a Jitter plot, we are able to decipher the different animal types and the different frequencies that show up throughout the time of year. The data I focused on in this question was reports that were labeled Not flighted, Fledgling, Orphaned, and Orphaned, Found Alone, Egg Alone which are different characteristics of animals. By also separating animals with more care, we could be able to provide more attention to the orphaned and baby animals through different Think Wild services. We were able to conclude that Baby seasons typically occurs throughout the summer season (June-August), however, those that need more care are seen just before that time range which is from April to Early July.

3. What time of year should we encourage people to install bird-safe window decals?

For this question, we are focusing on birds in Central Oregon that have been reported to have a Window Strike in the area. The Stacked Ordered Area Chart is able to give us a better distinction throughout all animals and see if there would be a difference throughout the different animal types. The data I focused on was different animal types that are birds and was labeled under Window Strike. Using this graph, we were able to conclude that birds were more prone to these incidents around July, and around October.
